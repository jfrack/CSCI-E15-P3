## Description
Project composes of two tools: Lorem Ipsum Generator and Random User Generator.

* The Lorem Ipsum Generator creates random Latin paragraphs that can be inserted as a text placeholder
on pre-production websites.  The goal of the text is to be non-intrusive to the viewer who can direct
their attention to the layout and functionality rather than the content of the site.

* The Random User Generator creates fake user accounts than can be leveraged to initially seed databases and
aid in website testing.  The tool yields a few options including birthdate, profile, and password generation.
